What your game is about (your creative theme)
My game is a simulation on how certain choices a student makes in college can affect their gpa, studies, social life, and stress. 


Which branching concepts are demonstrated where
The first branch is when the player chooses the course load from A(Light),  B(Standard), or C(Heavy). Each choice will affect the players, gpa, study hours, and stress level. 


The second branch is the study options of Math, Programming, English and History. This branch affects the players, gpa, social points, and stress level. 

The different outcomes are results of branching.


How to run the game
Once the system starts, the player is prompted with a name Then the following stats are provided: gpa, study hours, social points and stress level. The player chooses between a letter grade of A,B, and C for their course load. Then they choose a subject between Programming, Math, English and History. Depending on the choices, the stats will update.  


What the different endings represent
The endings I choose are: 
Graduated with honors and balanced life"
High GPA but burnout"
"Graduated but less social"
"Average grades but good life"
"Finished with steady progress"
"Failed to maintain academic standing".
For example, the first choice, uses a range of stress levels and social points to depict having a balanced social life and good grades. Then the elif uses the stress level which shows good grades but at the cost of stress and a balanced social life.
